# Intelligent Image Repair and Super-Resolution System

## Background
Develop a comprehensive tool for revitalising aged photographs by automatically detecting and repairing defects while boosting resolution and perceptual quality.

## Objectives
1. Design a multi-scale super-resolution network that supports x2, x3, and x4 upscaling.
2. Implement an automated defect detection and restoration module for scratches, stains, creases, and similar damage.
3. Provide colour restoration and denoising algorithms to correct colour shifts and suppress noise.
4. Surface quality assessment capabilities using PSNR, SSIM, or related metrics.
